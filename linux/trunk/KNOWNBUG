The current implementation may not handle device reset correctly.
The following devices may have a problem about this issue.
	- USB storage devices with bad sectors
	- USB V4L devices which upload a firmware and do hardware reset
		(i.e., WinTV Card?)

UPDATE: I added some code for this issue. But, I am not sure it resolves the
problem.


A USB device which has multiple configurations (in the USB termiology) may not
work correctly.  If a user or its driver changes a configuration value, the
usbip driver gets be unbound, and then a connection are terminated.
A possible solution is that a user sets a propoer configuration value before he
binds a device to usbip. This can be done through a sysfs file.


Suspend will not work while importing remote devices.
This is a limitation due to the lack of automatic reconnection function.
