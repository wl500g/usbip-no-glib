In order to test, if hotplugging is set up correctly on your machine, you may
copy the file 'hotplug_test.hotplug' to /etc/hotplug.d/usb/ . If the 'usb'
directory does not exists, yet, create it.

Check, if hotplugging is enabled in your kernel.  If the file
/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug exists, then hotplugging is enabled.

Check, if your kernel is calling the correct hotplug helper.  This helper is
usually /sbin/hotplug .  You can check this by 'cat'ing the value of the above
/proc file.

  you@host $ cat /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug
  /sbin/hotplug

If the result is empty, set the hotplug helper

  you@host $ echo /sbin/hotplug > /proc/sys/kernel/hotplug


Now, if your hotplug system is set up correctly, the test script will create a
file /tmp/hotplug_test.log .
This file will hold some test results.
