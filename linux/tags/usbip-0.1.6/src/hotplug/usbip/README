This document describes the usage of the hotplug scripts for the usbip
project.

[Prerequisities]
	The Linux Hotplug System from
	http://linux-hotplug.sourceforge.net/

[Installation]
	copy this directory (usbip) to /etc
	(so you get /etc/usbip/)

	edit the configuration file /etc/usbip/usbip_export.conf

	copy usbip_export.hotplug to /etc/hotplug.d/usb/
	if the 'usb' directory does not exist, create it.

	The directory for hotplug scripts is a default from the Linux
	Hotplugging Project. Howvever, this directory may vary for your
	distribution.

[Operation]
	The hotplug script (usbip.hotplug) will be called, whenever there is a
	hotplug event, i.e. whenever a USB device is attached or removed.

	The script will then determin, if it runs on a server or a client.
	'on a server' means that the device is attached on the virtual host
	controller (vhci-hcd), and 'on a client' means that the device is
	physically attached and should be exported to the server.

	Client: On a client, the hotplug script will call all scripts in
	/etc/usbip/client.d/*.hotplug
	Those scripts are not passed any parameters, but they will inherit the
	environment variables from the hotplug script.
	The scripts will be run, _before_ the config gets parsed, and the
	device is exported.

	Server: On a server, the hotplug script will call all scripts in
	/etc/usbip/server.d/*.hotplug
	Those scripts are not passed any parameters, but they will inherit the
	environment variables from the hotplug script.
	The scripts on the server are executed only when devices are attached!

[Customization]

	You may place your own scripts in /etc/usbip/server.d/

	These scripts will be called whenever a device is attached to the
	virtual host controller.
	
	Your script will inherit the environment variables from the calling
	hotplug script.
	Those are (among others):
		CLIENT_ADDRESS 
			The IP address of the client 
		DEVPATH
			The path to the device in Sysfs
		ACTION
			only "add"

	You can, e.g. use these scripts to 'chown' a device when it is
	attached. 

	At this point, you cannot take action, if the device is unplugged.
