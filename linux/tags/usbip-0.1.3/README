Notice
    This is a "pre-alpha" release.  
    Some functions have not been implemented completely. There are a lot
    of bugs. But, I believe you can understand our concept by this
    implementation. Your contributions are welcome. Please contact me.


Overview
    The USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system
    over IP network. To share USB devices between computers with their
    full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB requests" into IP packets
    and transmits them between computers. Original USB device drivers and
    applications can be also used for remote USB devices without any
    modification of them.  A computer can use remote USB devices as if
    they were directly attached; for example, we can ...

        - USB storage devices: fdisk, mkfs, mount/umount, file operations,
          play a DVD movie and record a DVD-R media.  

        - USB keyboards and USB mice: use with linux console and X Window
          System.  

        - USB webcams and USB speakers: view webcam, capture image data and
          play some music.

        - USB printers, USB scanners, USB serial converters and USB Ethernet
          interfaces: ok, use fine. 

    In a client host, the VHCI (Virtual Host Controller Interface) driver
    is implemented as a USB host controller driver. The VHCI driver
    emulates a real USB host controller interface for virtual
    attachment/detachment, enumeration and initialization of remote USB
    devices. It encapsulates USB request blocks and then transmits USB/IP
    packets to remote server hosts. In a server host, the Stub driver is
    implemented as a USB per-device driver. The Stub driver decapsulates
    USB/IP packets into USB requests and then submit them to real USB
    devices. 

    For more information, please see http://usbip.naist.jp/.
    The detail is described in an academic paper.


Compile & Install
    USB/IP needs both kernel drivers and userland utilities.
    See ./{drivers, src}/README.


FAQ
    Q.  I want to know how it works.
    A.  Please read my technical papers which are available at
        http://usbip.naist.jp/.

    Q.  Why does not USB/IP support Linux version 2.4 ?
    A.  The USB driver stack of version 2.6 is dramatically improved and now
        very different from 2.4. I think 2.6 kernel is only suitable for it.
        Anyway, long days ago, I tried to develop it for 2.4 experimentally.
        Its code is now available at the download area. But, please understand
        it lacks some essential functionality and very unstable. Do not use
        it and do not ask me about it. I will never develop the 2.4 version of
        USB/IP anymore.

    Q.  "client" and "server" are confusing...
    A.  A server host has physical USB devices which are exported to a client
        host. In the server host, load vhci-hcd.ko and use usbipd.
        The client host imports a USB device virtually; the client host may
        not have a real USB device. In the client host, load usbip.ko and use usbip.

    Q.  USB/IP is stable ?
    A.  No. It is still at a *very* early development stage.

    Q.  Do you have a plan to develop the MS Windows client of USB/IP ?
    A.  Some people are trying to develop it. But, the Host Controller API of
        MS Windows is not well-documented. This issue was discussed
        in the project forum in sf.net.

    Q.  Does your USB/IP implementation have compatibility with Anywhere USB ?
    A.  No.

Thanks
    All the people who gave me comments, bug report, and helpful code!
    I refer some Linux kernel code; especially,
        drivers/usb/usb-skeleton.c
        drivers/usb/dummy_hcd.c
        drivers/usb/host/* .
